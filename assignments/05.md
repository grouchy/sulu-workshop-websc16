Show more information about single events
=========================================

Goal
----

At the moment, our event pages don't display a lot of information about an
event. Let's fix that.

Steps
-----

* Add a page template `app/Resources/templates/pages/event.xml`
* Include at least the following properties:
  * `start_date` of type `date`
  * `end_date` of type `date`
  * `location` of type `location`
* Add the Twig file `app/Resources/views/templates/event.html.twig` with the
  corresponding Twig code
* Change all event pages to use the new "Event" template and fill out the 
  missing information
  
Hints
-----

* A date can be formatted using `value|date(format)`, for example
  `content.start_date|date('Y/m/d')`
* Clear the cache to see the new template

More Information
----------------

The **Location** content type provides a lot of functionality for selecting a
geographic location. It stores all the information you need for displaying
its name, address and its precise location on a Google Map.

Bonus Task
----------

* Use Google Maps to render the location
