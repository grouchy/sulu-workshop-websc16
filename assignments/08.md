Add a footer navigation
=======================

Goal
----

Let's add a footer navigation to show links to other globally accessible pages,
such as "Contact" or "About".

Steps
-----

* Add navigation context `footer` to `app/Resources/webspaces/sulu.websc16.xml`
* In the admin UI, add the pages "Contact" and "About" and tick the new
  "Footer Navigation" checkbox in the navigation dropdown of the "Settings" tab
* Render the footer navigation in `app/Resources/views/master.html.twig`

Hints
-----

* Example Twig code for the navigation can be found in
  `examples/footer-navigation.html.twig`

More Information
----------------

As we have seen with the main navigation in a previous assignment, Sulu supports
any number of parallel navigation contexts. After solving this task, each page
can be added to either of the navigation contexts `main` or `footer` or even
both of them. This gives a lot of flexibility to the content manager to
configure each navigation precisely how they need it.
