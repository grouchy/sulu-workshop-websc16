Add a second language
=====================

Goal
----

One of Sulu's biggest strengths is its multilinguality. Let's add a second
locale so that we can translate pages to another language.

Steps
-----

* Add a second locale to the `localizations` element of
  `app/Resources/webspaces/sulu.websc16.xml`, such as "de", "it" or "fr"
* Remove the `language` attribute from the urls in
  `app/Resources/webspaces/sulu.websc16.xml` and add a `{localization'}
  placeholder
* Execute `bin/adminconsole sulu:document:init` to initialize the new language
* Add the permissions for the new localization to your user
* In the admin UI, switch the language of the "Homepage" to the new locale,
  add translations and save
* Add a language switcher to `app/Resources/views/master.html.twig` to switch
  between different languages of a page

Hints
-----

* You may need to clear the cache after adding the localization: `rm -rf var/cache/*`
* Example Twig code for the language switcher can be found in
  `examples/locale-switcher.html.twig`
