Display additional information in the event list
================================================

Goal
----

Let's enrich the event listing with the information we added in the previous
step.

Steps
-----

* Modify the smart content property `events` in 
  `app/Resources/templates/pages/events.xml` to pass the `start_date` and the
  `end_date` of the embedded events to the template
* Print the dates in `app/Resources/views/templates/events.html.twig`

Hints
-----

* Add a `param` with the name `properties` to the XML and include the names of
  the properties that you want to pass. See the documentation for an example:
  http://docs.sulu.io/en/latest/reference/content-types/smart_content.html#page-template
* The `name` attributes of the nested `param`s contain the names of the
  properties in Twig (i.e. `{{ event.<name> }}`)
* The `value` attributes contain the names of the selected properties

More Information
----------------

When fetching pages matching a smart content, Sulu does not select *all*
properties by default for performance reasons. If you want to display a
property in a smart content, you have to tell Sulu to fetch it for you.
