Add thumbnail configuration
===========================

Goal
----

The header image on the homepage is displayed in the original dimensions. To
match our design, we need it to be as wide as the content. Let's display the
image in the right size.

Steps
-----

* Add the file `app/config/image-formats.xml` with the format `1140x450`
* Adjust `app/Resources/views/templates/homepage.html.twig` to display the
  thumbnail in the right dimension
  
Hints
-----

* An example image format file can be found in `examples/image-formats.xml`
* Access the thumbnail URL with `content.header[0].thumbnails['1140x450']`
* Clear the cache might help when the image format is not recognized

More Information
----------------

Sulu uses image formats to transparently create thumbnails for uploaded images.
A thumbnail is generated when it is accessed for the first time. That means that
only the thumbnails that you really use are stored on disk.

The default formats are stored under `Resources/config/image-formats.xml` of
Sulu's MediaBundle. Custom formats can be added on demand, as you learn in
this task.

Different strategies can be used to resize images. These are stored in the
`action` element. The most used action is `scale`, which crops an image into
the desired window, keeping its original aspect ratio.

Sulu uses ImageMagick to resize the images.
