Add a header image to the homepage
==================================

Goal
----

Our homepage is currently a bit naked. To stir our users' emotions when they
enter the page, we'd like to add a nice header image.

Steps
-----

* Add a new property `header` to `app/Resources/templates/pages/homepage.xml`
* Log into the admin UI with user "admin" and password "admin"
* Switch to "Assets" and create a new asset collection named "Headers"
* Upload some image to the collection
* Modify the "Homepage", select the header image and save
* Output the image in `app/Resources/views/templates/homepage.html.twig`

Hints
-----

* Use Google Images to find a nice image
* Use `{{ dump(content) }}` in the Twig template to find out how to output the
  header image URL

More Information
----------------

To solve this assignment, we need to understand a few different concepts in
Sulu:

Each page in Sulu has a **template**. The template consists of two parts:

* an XML file with the structure of the page
* an HTML (Twig) file with the HTML of the page

A template is made up of **properties**. Each property has a name (for example
"title") and a (content) type (for example `text_line`). The supportet content
types can be found in the documentation:
