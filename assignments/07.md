Display excerpts in the event list
==================================

Goal
----

Our event listing is still missing a short description of each event. Let's use
"excerpts" in Sulu to add this piece of information.

Steps
-----

* In the admin UI, switch to the "Excerpt & Categories" page of each event and
  insert a "Title" and "Description"
* In the event listing, show that title and description
* If no excerpt title is set, display the regular title

Hints
-----

* Like in the previous step, we need to tell our smart content to pass the 
  properties `excerpt.title` and `excerpt.description` to the event listing by
  adding the corresponding `param`s
* Use `event.excerpt_title|default(event.title)` to fall back to the regular
  title if no excerpt title is set
  
More Information
----------------

**Excerpts** in Sulu contain additional information about a page that is
displayed when the page is embedded into another page, such as with a smart
content. They are a useful tool for content managers to optimize the text
shown in such listings.
