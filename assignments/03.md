Add a main navigation
=====================

Goal
----

In order to navigate between the most important pages of our website, we'd like
to display them in a navigation on the top of the page.

Steps
-----

* In the admin UI, add a few new pages, such as "Events" or "Artists"
* In the "Settings" tab of these pages, tick the checkbox next to "Main 
  Navigation" in the navigation dropdown and save
* Display the navigation in `app/Resources/views/master.html.twig`

Hints
-----

* Pages can be added under "Web Summer Camp 16" Â» "Content"
* The file `examples/main-navigation.html.twig` shows example Twig code

More Information
----------------

Sulu has different **navigation contexts**, each of which are usually rendered
in a single navigation. Pages have to be added to such a navigation context
manually, as you did by ticking the checkbox in the "Settings" tab.

The navigation context `main` is defined in `app/Resources/webspaces/sulu.websc16.xml`.
