Add the page template "Events"
==============================

Goal
----

We'd like to display a list of events on our website.

Steps
-----

* Add a few event pages as children of the page "Events"
* Add a new template `app/Resources/templates/pages/events.xml` with a property
  `events` of type `smart_content`
* Add a Twig file `app/Resources/views/templates/events.html.twig` for rendering
  the template
* In the admin UI, change the template of the "Events" page to the new template
* Click the button of the "Events" property to configure the smart content.
  Use the "Events" page as data source.
* Display the titles of the events in `events.html.twig`

Hints
-----

* Use `app/Resources/templates/pages/default.xml` as base for your XML
* Use `app/Resources/views/templates/default.hml.twig` as base for your Twig file
* Use `{{ dump(content) }}` to find out how to render the event titles and their
  URLs
* Clear the cache to see the templates

More Information
----------------

We are using a new content type **Smart Content** in this assignment. This type
is used to embed information of other pages in the current page. It provides a
lot of flexibility: The content manager (i.e. the user in the admin UI) is able 
to select precisely which pages should be displayed by configuring the smart
content in the admin UI.

Smart content supports different ways of fetching data:

* Loading all children of a page
* Loading all pages matching some tag
* The displayed pages can be freely ordered
* The page set can be limited to a fixed count

While the content manager has the freedom to choose the *content* that should
be displayed, the frontend developer has complete control over *how that content
is rendered*.
